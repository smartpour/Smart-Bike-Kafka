The final Threshold workout file is a proof of concept. The code is written in C Sharp. 
In order for us to implement the proof of concept next trimester we need to convert the code file into Python so we can integrate it with the pi/mqtt values
The program asks the user for the threshold power and initiates the workout
The workout starts with a warm-up session, rest period, cooldown period and the proper workout. This loops through 2 intervals
I have kept the rest period and intervals to small values just so that the code can be easily tested
Once the workout is finished it outputs the sentence that the workout is complete
In the updated code I have used the power output as a percentage of the FTP.
